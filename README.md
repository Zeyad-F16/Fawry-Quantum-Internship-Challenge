Simple E-commerce Checkout System

This project is a basic Java application that simulates an e-commerce checkout process.

What this code does:

Product Management: It handles different types of products, such as Food (which has an expiration date and weight), Electronics (which have weight), and Digital products (which do not require shipping).

Shopping Cart: It allows products to be added to a shopping cart and checks for available quantities.

Full Checkout Process: It manages the entire checkout process, including:

Checking food item expiry dates.

Calculating shipping fees for products that require shipping.

Verifying customer balance.

Printing a detailed receipt and a shipment notice if there are shippable products.
